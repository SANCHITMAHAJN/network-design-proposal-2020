# Network-Design-Proposal-2020
This group project was developed in 2020 during my NESA course at Mohawk College. Here we developed a network infrastructure design for a company 'Zinfra', and proposed our ideas in the attached document.


* Designed a network infrastructure for a new office containing 400+ employees and spanning 4 floors. Involved in preparing the office layout, logical and physical designing, analyzing the network range, selecting appropriate routers, switches and cables, and calculating acquisition and yearly maintenance costs.

* Prepared an extensive report on the proposal and presented it on behalf of my team and secured 92% in the presentation.
